## Problems I have faced

I faced problems with the forground sercives that it stops after sometimes. I had to make some changes and test that frequently. I have a tendency to get more efficiency with short coding. But, I had to register sensors value twice one for the MainActivity and another for the forground services including live Notification to make the whole system effective. I also requested to whitelist the application from battery optimization.
